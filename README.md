🔒 1. Obscure Addresses for Privacy
All addresses shown in the Google Sheet and map are now “obscure addresses.” These are randomly generated within a 0.5-mile radius of the real address you originally entered.

This process happens only once — after the obscure address is created, your real address is overwritten and no longer stored in the sheet.

This approach protects your privacy and still preserves the accuracy of navigation distance and time calculations.

🙋 2. Use Initials or Aliases for Added Privacy
If you'd like an extra layer of privacy, feel free to enter initials, nicknames, or any memorable alias in the Name column, instead of full names. 

🏡 3. Host Family Designation
I've added a "Host Family" column in the Google Sheet. You can now designate a host for your group by selecting the corresponding checkbox. 

All calculated distances and times are relative to the host family’s location.
All calculated distances and times are relative to the host family’s location.

On the map, the host family is marked with a flashing icon so they are easy to locate visually.

🏡 4. Each small group is group by the locality of each member
So far, we have 3 small groups, 1=group-ScriptsRanch, 2=group-NorthCounty, 3=group-ChulaVista
